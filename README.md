# Unity Survival Game (scripts)

In the last couple of weeks I decided, that I'll make a survival game in Unity.
While I have learned quite some things in it, I figured, that it wasn't working for me,
so after weeks of work (& a dozen of bought assets/components), I'll be swithing to UE.
I'm obviously not an experienced C# developer (mainly because I started learning & working in it with this project),
but FOR MYSELF(!) the issues weren't that much code, but rather platform related
(one of the biggest being the lack of nested prefabs & for things to look good,
either spend a lot of time working on it or spend a lot of money to buy assets --

what I mean: "Yeah, I know what you mean. I've spent almost $6000 on Unity addons but boy I can make almost everything in no time ;-)").

Sooo, if you want to take some inspirations from my scripts ... there you go. :)
