# Unity Survival Game (scripts)

In the last couple of weeks I decided, that I'll make a survival game in Unity.
While I have learned quite some things in it, I figured, that it wasn't working for me (ant this specific project), so after weeks of work (& a dozen of bought assets/components), I'll be swithing to UE.
I'm obviously not an experienced C# developer (mainly because I started learning & working in it with this project), but FOR MYSELF(!) the issues weren't that much code, but rather platform related
(one of the biggest being the lack of nested prefabs & for things to look good, either spend a lot of time working on it or spend a lot of money to buy assets -- [here's](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?98600-Why-is-Unity-the-most-popular-engine&p=636860&viewfull=1#post636860) what I mean: "Yeah, I know what you mean. I've spent almost $6000 on Unity addons but boy I can make almost everything in no time ;-)").

Sooo, if you want to take some inspirations from my scripts ... there you go. :)

## Other tips

* Use namespaces
* In the assets, ALWAYS create a root folder (such as "Game/") & put stuff there in (Materials, Prefabs, Textures, ...), because your imported assets will for sure polute your root assets folder (I know that you could also move all the 3rd party assets, but that can get annoying if you have many of them)
